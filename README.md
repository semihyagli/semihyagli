# I knew it was you who were spying on me!

Now that you've discovered my *super-secret* GitHub profile, allow me to properly introduce myself to save you from the trouble. <br/>

**_TLDR version of the below_**: [**My Resume**](./CV-Semih%20Yagli_2507.pdf) and [**My Research Portfolio**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4GHnRnIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [**My LinkedIn Profile**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/semihyagli/).

My name is **_Semih Yagli_**, and I hold a _Ph.D._ in _Electrical and Computer Engineering_ from **Princeton University**.
I am currently working at Walmart Inc. as a **Staff Data Scientist**. However, thinking that this is all there is to know about me would be a great mistake... <br/> 

Since I have too many great ideas to fit into a standard 40-hour work week, I spend a lot of my free time on long-term side projects. One of these projects recently bore fruits: <br/>

I developed **_Etiqueta_** - the one and only gamified mobile data labeling application capable of handling picture classification, query-image relevance labeling, customer preference data collection, image segmentation, explicit query typo collection, and much more, all from mobile devices. Designed primarily with mobile use in mind (but also optimized for a solid desktop experience), Etiqueta is available at [**Apple App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/etiqueta/id6504646776) as well as [**Android Google Play Store**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aidatalabel.etiqueta). <br/>

As a result of Etiqueta, my game players labeled **_100,000_** _previously unlabeled_ images from the popular _STL10_ dataset, which I published it in this [_repository_](https://github.com/semihyagli/STL10-Labeled) under the name STL10-Labeled. <br/>

Additionally, thanks to Etiqueta once again, my game players segmented **_8,000_** images from the STL10 dataset, which I published it in this other [_repository_](https://github.com/semihyagli/STL10_Segmentation) under the name STL10-Segmentation. <br/>

For those interested, Etiqueta is at your service for DIY data labeling projects. It suffices to contact me at [_contact@aidatalabel.com_](mailto:contact@aidatalabel.com). <br/>

If you are impressed by the above and would like to help me out, you are always welcome to [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/semihyagli), or [sponsor me thorugh GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/semihyagli). I would be forever indebted. <br/>

Currently, I am working on a yet another _ultra-top-secret-super-important-and-amazing_ project with a friend. No further comments on this topic for now... <br/>

If you are not impressed just yet, perhaps this last note will do the trick. A fun fact about me is that I am a polyglot. Currently fluent in _English_, _French_, _Spanish_ and _Turkish_, I learn languages for the pure joy of learning and challenging myself. As I am working towards expanding my Spanish vocabulary, I plan to move on to my next challenge, Italian, by early 2026, then Portugese, then German and so on... until I have enough other problems (hopefully never).

On the more sociable side, since otherwise all work and no play would make Semih a dull boy, I am the _graduate alumni leader_ of **Princeton Alumni Association of Essex and Hudson Counties** (**PAAEHs** in short). I help our regional alumni association to organize networking events geared towards the potential interests of Princeton Graduate alumni. If you are a Princetonian in the region with a great get-together idea, please do not hesitate to reach out. Additionally, I am also a member of **INFORMS** and serve on its _Career Services Committee_. 

If you have interesting propositions, and/or job offers, and/or ideas, and/or think that I am really cool and would like to just connect, feel free to reach out to me at [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/semihyagli/) with a message. <br/>

ES: _Si usted es hispanohablante, me encantarÃ­a que me escribiera en espaÃ±ol. Me encanta cualquier oportunidad para practicar mi idioma favorito siempre que pueda, especialmente cuando es gratis ðŸ˜‰._ <br/>

FR: _Si vous Ãªtes francophone, jâ€™aimerais bien que vous mâ€™Ã©criviez en franÃ§ais. Je cherche toujours des occasions de parler cette belle langue, mais malheureusement, il y en a peu lÃ  oÃ¹ jâ€™habite._ <br/>

TR: _EÄŸer TÃ¼rkÃ§e biliyorsanÄ±z â€“ ya da emin olmasanÄ±z bile bildiÄŸinizi dÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼nÃ¼yorsanÄ±z ðŸ˜Š â€“ lÃ¼tfen mesajÄ±nÄ±zÄ± TÃ¼rkÃ§e yazmaktan Ã§ekinmeyin._ <br/>

IT, PT, DE: If you speak Italian, Portugese, or German, you will have to wait, respectively 3, 5 and 7 years until I learn and be able to give you special treatment like the above. Unfortunately, I have only 168 hours per week and learning a language takes time...

Thank you for taking the time to read!

Sincerely, <br/>
Semih Yagli

(this little note is mostly a reminder for my future self)
